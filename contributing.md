# Contribution Guidelines

Not all tools can be considered. The aim of the list is to provide a concise list of awesome CLI tools and apps. This means that suggested software should:  
  
(a) Be a tool designed to be used through the command-line, not a tool with CLI added as an afterthough  
(b) Do one thing and do it well  

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the App and why it should be included.

Thank you for your suggestions!
